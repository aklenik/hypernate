# CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery.

## Workflows

| Workflow         | File                                         | Purpose                                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build & Test     | `.github/workflows/build.yml`                | Formatting checks, compilation, and tests                 |
| Build Documentation | `.github/workflows/docs-build.yml`        | Lints Markdown and validates the documentation site       |
| Deploy Documentation | `.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml`      | Publishes the documentation site via mike                 |
| Triage Label     | `.github/workflows/triage_label.yml`         | Labels newly opened issues with `needs-triage`            |
| Design Approval  | `.github/workflows/check_design_approval.yml`| Flags PRs without a linked design/approved issue          |
| Stale PRs        | `.github/workflows/stale_not_approved.yml`   | Marks and eventually closes stale, non-approved PRs       |

## Build & Test

The Build & Test workflow runs `spotlessCheck`, `assemble`, and `test` on pushes and pull
requests that touch code-relevant files.

Documentation-only changes are skipped via path filters.

If a new commit is pushed while a run is already in progress for the same branch, the older run is
automatically canceled.

## Build Documentation

The Build Documentation workflow runs two checks, both identical to what contributors run locally:

1. `npx markdownlint-cli2` — Markdown conventions, most importantly 2-space list nesting
   (see the [documentation guide](../contributing/documentation.md#markdown-conventions)).
2. `mkdocs build --strict` — a broken internal link or a page missing from `nav` fails the check
   instead of breaking the deployment after merge.

It runs on every pull request, regardless of which files changed. This is deliberate: a required
status check that is skipped by a path filter never reports its result, which would block the PR
from merging. Instead, a filter step inside the job detects whether any documentation files
changed and skips the build steps otherwise, so unrelated PRs pass immediately. On branch pushes
(before a PR exists), path filters do apply, providing early feedback only when documentation
files change.

Both this workflow and Deploy Documentation set up their Python environment through the shared
composite action `.github/actions/setup-docs`.

## Deploy Documentation

The Deploy Documentation workflow publishes the site with [mike](https://github.com/jimporter/mike)
on pushes to `main` (as the `latest` version) and on `v*.*.*` tags (as a versioned snapshot).
Deployments are serialized: concurrent runs would race on the `gh-pages` branch, so a new run
queues behind an in-progress one instead of canceling it.

## Triage Label

When an issue is opened, the Triage Label workflow automatically adds the `needs-triage` label so
new issues are easy to find and route.

## Design Approval

On every pull request (opened, edited, synchronized, or reopened), the Design Approval workflow checks that the PR links to an issue carrying the `design/approved` label.
PRs that lack such a linked issue are flagged via the `needs-approved-issue` label.

Because the workflow is triggered by changes to the PR, it will not rerun if a non-`design/approved` issue gets the `design/approved` label.
In these cases, either a maintainer can force rerun the check or you can make a dummy change to the PR body (like adding a newline) and it will trigger the workflow.

## Stale PRs

A scheduled daily job marks pull requests carrying the `needs-approved-issue` label as `stale`
after 14 days of inactivity and closes them after 60 days. PRs labeled `pinned` or `security` are
exempt. Issues are never affected.

## Reading CI Results

1. **Status check on PRs** - The workflow result appears as a check on the pull request page.
2. **Actions tab** - Open the repository Actions tab to view workflow runs.
3. **Test report artifact** - Every run uploads an HTML test report artifact retained for 14 days.

## Troubleshooting

### Formatting Check Failed

The `spotlessCheck` step enforces Google Java Format. To fix locally:

```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

This reformats source files in place. Commit the changes and push again.

### Test Failure

Check the uploaded test report artifact:

1. Open the failed workflow run in the Actions tab.
2. Scroll to the **Artifacts** section.
3. Download **test-report** and open `index.html` in a browser.

The report shows failing tests with stack traces and assertion messages.
